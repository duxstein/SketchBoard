# Hooks Module

**Purpose**: Custom React hooks for canvas, tools, and collaboration.

This module contains:

- Canvas hooks (viewport, rendering)
- Tool hooks (active tool, tool state)
- Collaboration hooks (presence, sync status)
- State subscription hooks (minimal re-renders)

**Key Principle**: Hooks must enable React components to interact with canvas/collaboration without causing performance issues.
